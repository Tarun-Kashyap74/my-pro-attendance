## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 Advanced Tracking & Prediction
* **Smart Stats:** View real-time attendance percentage, total classes, and present/absent counts.

### 🗓️ Smart Timetable & Alerts
* **Day-wise Schedule:** Manage your weekly timetable with a clean, day-wise interface.

* **Next Class Indicator:** Always see which class is coming up next on the home screen.

### 🎨 Personalization & UI
* **Premium UI:** Glassmorphism-inspired design with floating navigation and smooth animations.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between a clean Light mode and a battery-saving Dark mode.
* **Themes:** Customize the app's accent color (Purple, Blue, Orange, Green, Pink, Black) to match your style.

### 🛠️ Productivity Tools
